# SIB-Net 
## Statement âš“
It is the primitive implementation for SIB-Net, which considers three relations for context-aware emotion recognition. ðŸ”¥ This repository includes modules details, data preprocess, training strategy and confusion analysis. ðŸ’—

It would be helpful for your reimplementation or following, although I am not sure. ðŸ˜… You know, figuring out from HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of experimnets files is struggling and confusing. ðŸ’¢

Anyway, fighting !!! I will continue to update this repository, if you need. ðŸ’‹ But it takes time :).
